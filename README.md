I developed a Flutter-based restaurant ordering application designed for a seamless and user-friendly experience. The app features an intuitive menu interface showcasing delicious burgers with images, prices, and ratings. Users can browse items, view best-seller recommendations, and place orders effortlessly.

With a focus on performance optimization and smooth API integration, the app ensures a fast, interactive, and visually appealing experience. The modern UI design, responsive layout, and fluid navigation enhance user engagement, making the ordering process simple and efficient.
